## Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a creative and resourceful data engineer, report developer and cybersecurity analyst with a diverse work history looking to provide support for operations efficiency, integration, and innovation.
I especially like to provide solutions for non-profits looking to have their data cleaned, standardized, readied for analysis, and secured.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the LeetCode SQL 50!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently applying a security-first approach to my work.
- ðŸ‘¯ I'm looking to collaborate on data cleansing & security topics.

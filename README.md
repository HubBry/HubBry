## Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a creative and resourceful data engineer, report developer and cybersecurity analyst with a diverse work history looking to provide support for operations efficiency, integration, and innovation. 

I'm a "bridge between silos." I create hybrid technology solutions and data standardizations that embrace new technologies, integrate tried-and-true legacy approaches and respect colleague preferences, all with a security-first ethos. I also edit video: https://youtu.be/kVJzCenDjP8.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the LeetCode SQL 50!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about applying my Cybersecurity training from NuCamp.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on data cleansing & Power BI connectivity.
